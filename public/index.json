The Investigation of Serial studies to Predict Your Therapeutic Response with Imaging And moLecular Analysis (ISPY COVID-19 trial) was designed and implemented in early 2020 to evaluate investigational agents rapidly and simultaneously on a phase 2 adaptive platform. This manuscript outlines the design, rationale, implementation and challenges of the ISPY COVID-19 trial during the first phase of trial activity from April 2020 until December 2021. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The ISPY COVID-19 Trial is a multicentre open-label phase 2 platform trial in the USA designed to evaluate therapeutics that may have a large effect on improving outcomes from severe COVID-19. The ISPY COVID-19 Trial network includes academic and community hospitals with significant geographical diversity across the country. Enrolled patients are randomised to receive one of up to four investigational agents or a control and are evaluated for a family of two primary outcomes-time to recovery and mortality. The statistical design uses a Bayesian model with 'stopping' and 'graduation' criteria designed to efficiently discard ineffective therapies and graduate promising agents for definitive efficacy trials. Each investigational agent arm enrols to a maximum of 125 patients per arm and is compared with concurrent controls. As of December 2021, 11 investigational agent arms had been activated, and 8 arms were complete. Enrolment and adaptation of the trial design are ongoing. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: ISPY COVID-19 operates under a central institutional review board via Wake Forest School of Medicine IRB00066805. Data generated from this trial will be reported in peer-reviewed medical journals.

The surgical community has put hope in robot-assisted radical cystectomy (RARC) with intracorporeal urinary diversion (ICUD) in an effort to improve surgical outcomes and bladder cancer survival without strong supporting evidence.To evaluate perioperative, safety, and survival outcome differences between RARC with ICUD and open radical cystectomy (ORC).This nationwide population-based cohort study used data from the Swedish National Register of Urinary Bladder Cancer and population-based Cause of Death Register, which includes clinical information on tumor characteristics, treatment, and survival and covers approximately 97% of patients with urinary bladder cancer in Sweden. All patients who underwent radical cystectomy for bladder cancer in any hospital between January 2011 and December 2018 were included. Follow-up data were collected until December 2019. Data analysis was conducted from June to December 2020.RARC or ORC.The main outcomes were all-cause and cancer-specific mortality between RARC and ORC, compared using propensity score matching. Secondary outcomes were differences in perioperative outcomes after the different surgical approaches.Throughout the observation period, 889 patients underwent RARC and 2280 patients underwent ORC at 24 Swedish hospitals. The median (IQR) age was 71 (66-76) years and 2386 patients (75.3%) were men. After a median (IQR) follow-up of 47 (28-71) months, the 5-year cancer-specific mortality rates were 30.2% (variance, 1.59) for ORC and 27.6% (variance, 3.12) for RARC, and the overall survival rates were 57.7% (variance, 2.46) for ORC and 61.4% (variance, 5.11) for RARC. In the propensity score–matched analysis, RARC was associated with a lower all-cause mortality (hazard ratio, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.56-0.89; P,=,.004). Compared with ORC, RARC was associated with a lower estimated blood loss (median [IQR] 150 [100-300] mL vs 700 [400-1300] mL; P,\u003c,.001), intraoperative transfusion rate (odds ratio [OR], 0.05; 95% CI, 0.03-0.08; P,\u003c,.001), and shorter length of stay (median [IQR], 9 [6-13] days vs 13 [10-17] days; P,\u003c,.001), and with a higher lymph node yield (median [IQR], 20 [15-27] lymph nodes vs 14 [8-24] lymph nodes; P,\u003c,.001) and 90-day rehospitalization rate (OR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.02-1.60; P,=,.03). The RARC group, compared with the ORC group had lower risk of Clavien-Dindo grade III or higher complications (OR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.43-0.87; P,=,.009).These findings suggest that compared with ORC, RARC with ICUD was associated with a lower overall mortality rate, fewer high-grade complications, and more favorable perioperative outcomes.","tags":null,"title":"Association of Open vs Robot-Assisted Radical Cystectomy With Mortality and Perioperative Outcomes Among Patients With Bladder Cancer in Sweden","type":"publication"},{"authors":["De Laere B","Crippa A","Discacciati A","Larsson B","Oldenburg J","Mortezavi A","Ost P","Eklund M","Lindberg J","Gronberg H","{undefined}"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1647648000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1647648000,"objectID":"aa1c070453448f2f543f182d804cd961","permalink":"https://6346b314635e8e77d95c6d10--luminous-stardust-9f8aab.netlify.app/publication/2022-03-19_clinical_trial_proto/","publishdate":"2022-03-19T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2022-03-19_clinical_trial_proto/","section":"publication","summary":"Europe PMC is an archive of life sciences journal literature.","tags":null,"title":"Clinical Trial Protocol for ProBio: An Outcome-Adaptive and Randomised Multiarm Biomarker-Driven Study in Patients with Metastatic Prostate Cancer.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Carolyn S.

The effect of antipsychotics on negative symptoms should be taken into account because patients will often continue on the treatment received in the acute phase. Therefore, we conducted a formal dose-response meta-analysis of negative symptoms and positive symptoms based on a systematic review of fixed-dose randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that examined the effectiveness of antipsychotics for the acute exacerbation of schizophrenia. Forty RCTs included a total of 15,689 patients. The 95% effective doses per day for the 13 antipsychotics included and 3 long acting were mostly different for negative and positive symptoms: amisulpride (481,mg, 690.6,mg); aripiprazole (11.9,mg, 11,mg); asenapine (7.61,mg, 5.66,mg); brexpiprazole (2.1,mg, 4,mg); cariprazine (4,mg, 6.51,mg); haloperidol (6.34,mg, 7.36,mg); lurasidone (58.2,mg, 86.3,mg); olanzapine (15.5,mg, 9.52,mg); olanzapine long-acting injection (15.7,mg, 13.5,mg); paliperidone (7.2,mg, 7,mg); paliperidone long-acting injection (7.5,mg, 5.9,mg); quetiapine instant-release (264.2,mg, 316.5,mg); quetiapine extended-release (774,mg, 707.2,mg); risperidone (7.5,mg, 7.7,mg); risperidone long-acting injection (5.13,mg, 6.7,mg); sertindole (13.5,mg, 16.3,mg); and ziprasidone (71.6,mg, 152.6,mg). The shape of the dose-response curves varied across different drugs with most drugs showing a plateau at higher doses. Most dose-response curves suggested that the near-maximum effective doses could be in the lower-to-medium range of the licensed dose. Additional RCTs are necessary to establish the optimal dose.","tags":["Pharmacology","Schizophrenia"],"title":"Antipsychotics for Negative and Positive Symptoms of Schizophrenia: Dose-Response Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Acute Phase Trials","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Michel Sabe","Nan Zhao","Alessio Crippa","Gregory P Strauss","Stefan Kaiser"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1627776000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1627776000,"objectID":"06ea23c0cb47d4bce2c4b3165ced138f","permalink":"https://6346b314635e8e77d95c6d10--luminous-stardust-9f8aab.netlify.app/publication/2021-08-01_intranasal_oxytocin_/","publishdate":"2021-08-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2021-08-01_intranasal_oxytocin_/","section":"publication","summary":"Negative symptoms are a core aspect of psychopathology in schizophrenia. Currently available pharmacological agents have proven minimally efficacious for remediating negative symptoms. A promising treatment avenue is the intranasal administration of the neuropeptide oxytocin. However, there have been inconsistencies in effects of oxytocin on negative symptoms throughout the literature, and factors leading to inconsistent effects are unclear.We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials to compare the effectiveness of oxytocin with placebo for the treatment of negative symptoms and determine moderators of treatment effect. Random effects meta-analyses and dose-response meta-analysis were performed on mean changes in negative symptoms.In an initial analysis of all 9 identified randomized clinical trials, intranasal oxytocin showed no significant effect on negative symptoms. For higher doses (\u003e40–80 IU), a beneficial effect on negative symptoms was found with a moderate effect size, but this effect disappeared after exclusion of 1 outlier study. The dose-response meta-analysis predicted that higher doses of oxytocin may be more efficacious for negative symptoms. For positive symptoms, no beneficial effect of oxytocin was found in the main meta-analysis, but the dose-response meta-analysis suggested a potential advantage of higher doses.The present results show no consistent beneficial effect of intranasal oxytocin for the treatment of negative and positive symptoms. The dose-response meta-analysis does not allow drawing any firm conclusions but suggests that high doses of intranasal oxytocin may be more efficacious. If future studies are conducted, an effort to reach adequate CNS concentrations for a sufficient duration is required.","tags":null,"title":"Intranasal Oxytocin for Negative Symptoms of Schizophrenia: Systematic Review, Meta-Analysis, and Dose-Response Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mikael Eriksson","Martin Eklund","Signe Borgquist","Roxanna Hellgren","Sara Margolin","Linda Thoren","Ann Rosendahl","Kristina Lang","Jose Tapia","Magnus Backlund","Andrea Discacciati","Alessio Crippa","Marike Gabrielson","Mattias Hammarstrom","Yvonne Wengstrom","Kamila Czene","Per Hall"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1623283200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1623283200,"objectID":"e1c0e4061ec489aa5789963502cc5c4e","permalink":"https://6346b314635e8e77d95c6d10--luminous-stardust-9f8aab.netlify.app/publication/2021-06-10_low-dose_tamoxifen_f/","publishdate":"2021-06-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2021-06-10_low-dose_tamoxifen_f/","section":"publication","summary":"PURPOSE Tamoxifen prevents breast cancer in high-risk women and reduces mortality in the adjuvant setting. Mammographic density change is a proxy for tamoxifen therapy response. We tested whether lower doses of tamoxifen were noninferior to reduce mammographic density and associated with fewer symptoms. PATIENTS AND METHODS Women, 40-74 years of age, participating in the Swedish mammography screening program were invited to the 6-month double-blind six-arm randomized placebo-controlled noninferiority dose-determination KARISMA phase II trial stratified by menopausal status (EudraCT 2016-000882-22). In all, 1,439 women were accrued with 1,230 participants accessible for intention-to-treat analysis. The primary outcome was proportion of women treated with placebo, 1, 2.5, 5, and 10 mg whose mammographic density decreased at least as much as the median reduction in the 20 mg arm. The noninferior margin was 17%. Secondary outcome was reduction of symptoms. Post hoc analyses were performed by menopausal status. Per-protocol population and full population were analyzed in sensitivity analysis. RESULTS The 1,439 participants, 566 and 873 pre- and postmenopausal women, respectively, were recruited between October 1, 2016, and September 30, 2019. The participants had noninferior mammographic density reduction following 2.5, 5, and 10 mg tamoxifen compared with the median 10.1% decrease observed in the 20 mg group, a reduction confined to premenopausal women. Severe vasomotor symptoms (hot flashes, cold sweats, and night sweats) were reduced by approximately 50% in the 2.5, 5, and 10 mg groups compared with the 20 mg group. CONCLUSION Premenopausal women showed noninferior magnitude of breast density decrease at 2.5 mg of tamoxifen, but fewer side effects compared with the standard dose of 20 mg. Future studies should test whether 2.5 mg of tamoxifen reduces the risk of primary breast cancer.","tags":null,"title":"Low-Dose Tamoxifen for Mammographic Density Reduction: A Randomized Controlled Trial","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Anna Lantz","Erik Skaaheim Haug","Wolfgang Picker","Alessio Crippa","Fredrik Jaderling","Ashkan Mortezavi","Tobias Nordstrom"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1617235200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1617235200,"objectID":"a83fbef4617bb32106231f34edfeaea2","permalink":"https://6346b314635e8e77d95c6d10--luminous-stardust-9f8aab.netlify.app/publication/2021-04-01_effect_of_informatio/","publishdate":"2021-04-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2021-04-01_effect_of_informatio/","section":"publication","summary":"To describe the predictive value of information on previous benign biopsy for the outcome of MRI-targeted biopsies.","tags":["Magnetic resonance imaging","MRI","Prostate biopsy","Prostate cancer","Prostate neoplasm","Targeted biopsy"],"title":"Effect of Information on Prostate Biopsy History on Biopsy Outcomes in the Era of MRI-Targeted Biopsies","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Bram {De Laere}","Alessio Crippa","Ashkan Mortezavi","Christophe Ghysel","Prabhakar Rajan","Martin Eklund","Alexander Wyatt","Luc Dirix","Piet Ost","Henrik Gronberg","Johan Lindberg","{on behalf of the CORE","ProBio Investigators}"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609459200,"objectID":"7e38d32eceba6eec8b7c6a9da3ddfc5a","permalink":"https://6346b314635e8e77d95c6d10--luminous-stardust-9f8aab.netlify.app/publication/2021-01_increased_pathway_co/","publishdate":"2021-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2021-01_increased_pathway_co/","section":"publication","summary":"Metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) is a heterogeneous disease, characterized by common and rare driver gene alterations that provide a selective growth advantage for progressing tumour cells. We hypothesized that the number of distinct gene driver alteration-affected pathways or gene classes was associated with poor prognosis in patients initiating androgen receptor signalling inhibitors (ARSi). We performed a post hoc analysis of an amalgamated baseline circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) mutational landscape dataset of ARSi-treated men with mCRPC (n = 342). We associated the detected hotspot, pathogenic, and/or high impact protein function-affecting perturbations in 39 genes into 13 pathways. Progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were analysed using Kaplan–Meier curves and multivariate Cox regression models. Driver gene alterations were detected in 192/342 (56.1%) evaluable patients. An increased number of affected pathways, coined pathway complexity index (PCI), resulted in a decremental PFS and OS, and was independently associated with prognosis once ≥3 pathway or gene classes were affected (PFS HR (95%CI): 1.7 (1.02–2.84), p = 0.04, and OS HR (95%CI): 2.5 (1.06–5.71), p = 0.04). Additionally, visceral disease and baseline PSA and plasma ctDNA levels were independently associated with poor prognosis.

Patients and Methods We conducted a retrospective analysis comparing postoperative complication and mortality rates depending on age in a consecutive series of 1890 patients who underwent RARC with ICUD for bladder cancer between 2004 and 2018 in 10 European centres. Outcomes of patients aged {$\u003c$}80 years and those aged ≥80 years were compared with regard to postoperative complications (Clavien–Dindo grading) and mortality rate. Cancer-specific mortality (CSM) and other-cause mortality (OCM) after surgery were calculated using the non-parametric Aalen-Johansen estimator. Results A total of 1726 patients aged {$\u003c$}80 years and 164 aged ≥80 years were included in the analysis. The 30- and 90-day rate for high-grade (Clavien–Dindo grades III–V) complications were 15% and 21% for patients aged {$\u003c$}80 years compared to 11% and 13% for patients aged ≥80 years (P = 0.2 and P = 0.03), respectively. In a multivariable logistic regression analysis adjusting for pre- and postoperative variables, age ≥80 years was not an independent predictor of high-grade complications (odds ratio 0.6, 95% confidence interval 0.3–1.1; P = 0.12). The non-cancer-related 90-day mortality was 2.3% for patients aged ≥80 years and 1.8% for those aged {$\u003c$}80 years, respectively (P = 0.7). The estimated 12-month CSM and OCM rates for those aged {$\u003c$}80 years were 8% and 3%, and for those aged ≥80 years, 15% and 8%, respectively (P = 0.009 and P {$\u003c$} 0.001). Conclusions The minimally invasive approach to RARC with ICUD for bladder cancer in well-selected elderly patients (aged ≥80 years) achieved a tolerable high-grade complication rate; the 90-day postoperative mortality rate was driven by cancer progression and the non-cancer-related rate was equivalent to that of patients aged {$\u003c$}80 years. However, an increased OCM rate in this elderly group after the first year should be taken into account. These results will support clinicians and patients when balancing cancer-related vs treatment-related risks and benefits.","tags":["BladderCancer","blcsm","EndoUrology","uroonc","bladder cancer","complication","intracorporeal diversion","mortality","octogenarian","robot-assisted radical cystectomy"],"title":"Morbidity and Mortality after Robot-Assisted Radical Cystectomy with Intracorporeal Urinary Diversion in Octogenarians: Results from the European Association of Urology Robotic Urology Section Scientific Working Group","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alessio Crippa","吳恩達"],"categories":["Demo","教程"],"content":"import libr print(\u0026#39;hello\u0026#39;) Overview The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.

Eligibility criteria Inclusion criteria related to follow-up (minimum 2 years), outcome (mortality from all causes, cancer, cardiovascular disease (CVD) or coronary heart disease), exposure (eg, a category of {$\u003e$}1000 metabolic equivalent of task (MET) min/week), study design (prospective cohort, nested case control or case-cohort) and reports of cases and person years of exposure categories. Information sources Systematic searches were conducted in Embase and Pubmed from database inception to 2 March 2019. Risk of bias The quality of the studies was assessed with the Newcastle–Ottawa scale. Included studies From 31 368 studies identified, 48 were included. Two authors independently extracted outcome estimates and assessed study quality. Synthesis of results We estimated hazard ratios (HRs) using random effect restricted cubic spline dose–response meta-analyses. Compared with the recommended level of physical activity (750 MET min/week), mortality risk was lower at physical activity levels exceeding the recommendations, at least until 5000 MET min/week for all cause mortality (HR=0.86, 95% CI 0.78 to 0.94) and for CVD mortality (HR=0.73, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.95). Strengths and limitations of evidence The strengths of this study include the detailed dose–response analyses, inclusion of 48 studies and examination of sources of heterogeneity. The limitations include the observational nature of the included studies and the inaccurate estimations of amount of physical activity. Interpretation Compared with the recommended level, mortality risk was lower at physical activity levels well above the recommended target range. Further, there was no threshold beyond which lifespan was compromised.

The authors sought to fill this gap by conducting dose-response meta-analyses. Methods: A search of multiple electronic databases (through November 2018) was conducted for all placebo-controlled dose-finding studies for 20 second-generation antipsychotic drugs and haloperidol (oral and long-acting injectable, LAI) in people with acute schizophrenia symptoms. Dose-response curves were constructed with random-effects dose-response meta-analyses and a spline model. The outcome measure was total score reduction from baseline on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale or the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale. The authors identified 95% effective doses, explored whether higher or lower doses than the currently licensed ones might be more appropriate, and derived dose equivalencies from the 95% effective doses. Results: Sixty-eight studies met the inclusion criteria. The 95% effective doses and the doses equivalent to 1 mg of oral risperidone, respectively, were as follows: amisulpride for patients with positive symptoms, 537 mg/day and 85.8 mg; aripiprazole, 11.5 mg/day and 1.8 mg; aripiprazole LAI (lauroxil), 463 mg every 4 weeks and 264 mg; asenapine, 15.0 mg/day and 2.4 mg; brexpiprazole, 3.36 mg/day and 0.54 mg; haloperidol, 6.3 mg/day and 1.01 mg; iloperidone, 20.13 mg/day and 3.2 mg; lurasidone, 147 mg/day and 23.5 mg; olanzapine, 15.2 mg/day and 2.4 mg; olanzapine LAI, 277 mg every 2 weeks and 3.2 mg; paliperidone, 13.4 mg/day and 2.1 mg; paliperidone LAI, 120 mg every 4 weeks and 1.53 mg; quetiapine, 482 mg/day and 77 mg; risperidone, 6.3 mg/day and 1 mg; risperidone LAI, 36.6 mg every 2 weeks and 0.42 mg; sertindole, 22.5 mg/day and 3.6 mg; and ziprasidone, 186 mg/day and 30 mg. For amisulpride and olanzapine, specific data for patients with predominant negative symptoms were available. The authors have made available on their web site a spreadsheet with this method and other updated methods that can be used to estimate dose equivalencies in practice. Conclusions: In chronic schizophrenia patients with acute exacerbations, doses higher than the identified 95% effective doses may on average not provide more efficacy. For some drugs, higher than currently licensed doses might be tested in further trials, because their dose-response curves did not plateau.","tags":["Antipsychotic Drugs","Dose-Response Curve","Meta-Analysis","Schizophrenia"],"title":"Dose-Response Meta-Analysis of Antipsychotic Drugs for Acute Schizophrenia","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Xingwu Zhou","Alessio Crippa","Anna-Karin Danielsson","Maria R.

Design Quasi-experimental design with an intervention time-series analysis based on 19 years series of data collected between January 1999 and August 2017 (224 months). Statistical inference on calling rates and rate ratios was obtained using intervention time-series models (Poisson regression and transfer functions). Participants A total of 179 851 phone calls to the SNTQ. Interventions Recent application of the 2014/40/ European Union (EU) Tobacco Products Directive in 2016. Historical interventions such as a campaign on passive smoking in January 2001; introduction of larger text warnings on cigarette packages since September 2002; banning smoking in restaurants since June 2005; and tobacco tax increase by 10% since January 2012. Outcome measure Calling rates to the SNTQ expressed per 100 000 smokers. Setting Sweden. Results The introduction of large pictorial warnings together with text warnings on cigarette packages (May 2016) was associated with a 35% increase in SNTQ calling rate (95% CI 1.16 to 1.57). The campaign on passive smoking (Jan 2001) was associated with a 61% higher calling rate (95% CI 1.06 to 2.45). Larger text warnings on cigarette packs (Sept 2002) conferred a 28% increment in the calling rate (95% CI 1.15 to 1.42); and prohibition to smoke in restaurants (Jun 2005) was associated with a 15% increase in the calling rate (95% CI 1.01 to 1.30). The 10% tobacco tax increase (Jan 2012) was associated with a 3% higher calling rate (95% CI 0.90 to 1.19). Conclusions Within an overall decreasing trend of daily smoking in Sweden, we found that the recent introduction of pictorial warnings together with text warnings and referral text had a discernible positive impact on the calling rates to the smoking quitline. We were also able to detect a likely impact of earlier nationwide interventions.","tags":["health policy","intervention time-series analysis","tobacco quitline","transfer functions"],"title":"Effect of Tobacco Control Policies on the Swedish Smoking Quitline Using Intervention Time-Series Analysis","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Wowchemy is designed to give technical content creators a seamless experience.

Design Systematic literature review and meta-analysis. Setting and Participants Community-dwelling older adults. Measures A systematic literature review was conducted on prospective studies identified through electronic and hand searches until October 2017. A random effects meta-analysis was used to evaluate the relative risk (RR) of experiencing falls and recurrent falls (≥2 falls within at least 6~months) on the basis of nutritional status, defined by multidimensional scores. A random effects dose-response meta-analysis was used to evaluate the association between BMI and the risk of falls and recurrent falls. Results People who were malnourished or those at risk for malnutrition had a pooled 45% higher risk of experiencing at least 1 fall than were those well-nourished (9510 subjects). Increased falls risk was observed in subjects malnourished versus well-nourished [RR 1.64, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.18-2.28; 3 studies, 8379 subjects], whereas no substantial results were observed for risk of recurrent falls. A U-shaped association was detected between BMI and the risk for falls (P~{$\u003c~$}.001), with the nadir between 24.5 and 30 (144,934 subjects). Taking a BMI of 23.5 as reference, the pooled RR of falling ranged between 1.09 (95% CI 1.04-1.15) for a BMI of 17, to 1.07 (95% CI 0.92-1.24) for a BMI of 37.5. No associations were observed between BMI and recurrent falls (120,185 subjects). Conclusions/Implications The results of our work suggest therefore that nutritional status and BMI should be evaluated when assessing the risk for falls in older age.","tags":["accidental falls","body mass index","Malnutrition","meta-analysis"],"title":"Nutritional Status, Body Mass Index, and the Risk of Falls in Community-Dwelling Older Adults: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alessio Crippa","Andrea Discacciati","Matteo Bottai","Donna Spiegelman","Nicola Orsini"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1556668800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1556668800,"objectID":"6a8f16863c0c43fffced7008c4a6fab5","permalink":"https://6346b314635e8e77d95c6d10--luminous-stardust-9f8aab.netlify.app/publication/2019-05-01_one-stage_doserespo/","publishdate":"2019-05-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2019-05-01_one-stage_doserespo/","section":"publication","summary":"The standard two-stage approach for estimating non-linear dose?response curves based on aggregated data typically excludes those studies with less than three exposure groups.

In a one-stage approach, the pooled curve and estimates of the between-studies heterogeneity are based on the whole set of studies without any exclusion. Thus, even complex curves (splines, spike at zero exposure) defined by several parameters can be estimated. We showed how the one-stage method may facilitate several applications, in particular quantification of heterogeneity over the exposure range, prediction of marginal and conditional curves, and comparison of alternative models. The one-stage method for meta-analysis of non-linear curves is implemented in the dosresmeta R package. It is particularly suited for dose?response meta-analyses of aggregated where the complexity of the research question is better addressed by including all the studies.","tags":null,"title":"One-Stage Dose–Response Meta-Analysis for Aggregated Data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tommaso Filippini","Elizabeth E.

To the best of our knowledge, no systematic reviews have summarized the most recently published evidence and no analyses have examined the dose–response relation. Objective: We investigated the extent to which outdoor air pollution, especially as resulting from traffic-related contaminants, affects the risk of childhood leukemia. Methods: We searched all case–control and cohort studies that have investigated the risk of childhood leukemia in relation to exposure either to motorized traffic and related contaminants, based on various traffic-related metrics (number of vehicles in the closest roads, road density, and distance from major roads), or to measured or modeled levels of air contaminants such as benzene, nitrogen dioxide, 1,3-butadiene, and particulate matter. We carried out a meta-analysis of all eligible studies, including nine studies published since the last systematic review and, when possible, we fit a dose–response curve using a restricted cubic spline regression model. Results: We found 29 studies eligible to be included in our review. In the dose–response analysis, we found little association between disease risk and traffic indicators near the child’s residence for most of the exposure range, with an indication of a possible excess risk only at the highest levels. In contrast, benzene exposure was positively and approximately linearly associated with risk of childhood leukemia, particularly for acute myeloid leukemia, among children under 6 y of age, and when exposure assessment at the time of diagnosis was used. Exposure to nitrogen dioxide showed little association with leukemia risk except at the highest levels. Discussion: Overall, the epidemiologic literature appears to support an association between benzene and childhood leukemia risk, with no indication of any threshold effect. A role for other measured and unmeasured pollutants from motorized traffic is also possible. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP4381","tags":null,"title":"Association between Outdoor Air Pollution and Childhood Leukemia: A Systematic Review and Dose–Response Meta-Analysis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alessio Crippa"],"categories":[],"content":"from IPython.core.display import Image Image(\u0026#39;https://www.python.org/static/community_logos/python-logo-master-v3-TM-flattened.png\u0026#39;) print(\u0026#34;Welcome to Academic!\u0026#34;) Welcome to Academic!

Our aim is to provide the most accurate and updated estimate of the dose–response relationships between cigarette smoking and pancreatic cancer risk. Methods Using an innovative approach for the identification of original publications, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of epidemiological studies published on the issue up to April 2017. Random effects models were used to provide pooled estimates for the cigarette smoking status; dose–risk relationships were evaluated using one-stage random effects models with restricted cubic splines. Results Seventy-eight studies were included, providing a pooled relative risk (RR) of pancreatic cancer of 1.8 (95% confidence interval, CI: 1.7–1.9) for the current and 1.2 (95% CI: 1.1–1.2) for the former vs. never smokers. A sharp increase in pancreatic cancer risk was found already with a low number of cigarettes and up to 30 cigarettes/day (RR 2.2, 95% CI: 1.9–2.4). Similarly, the risk of pancreatic cancer steady increased after a few years of smoking up to 30 years (RR 1.8, 95% CI: 1.6–2.0). The risk rapidly decreased with increasing time since quitting and was 0.6 (95% CI: 0.5–0.7, for the former vs. current smokers) after 20 years of quitting. Conclusions The present meta-analysis indicates that pancreatic cancer risk sharply increases with a low number of cigarettes or after a few years of smoking~and that it rapidly decreases a few years after cessation, although it takes almost 20 years to reach that of never smokers.","tags":["Dose–response relationship","Epidemiology","Meta-analysis","Pancreatic cancer","Prevention","Tobacco smoking"],"title":"Strong Excess Risk of Pancreatic Cancer for Low Frequency and Duration of Cigarette Smoking: A Comprehensive Review and Meta-Analysis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alessio Crippa","Ilias Thomas","Nicola Orsini"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1525737600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1525737600,"objectID":"8e17c2d2c21d270dfe49e8fed9585375","permalink":"https://6346b314635e8e77d95c6d10--luminous-stardust-9f8aab.netlify.app/publication/2018-05-08_a_pointwise_approach/","publishdate":"2018-05-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2018-05-08_a_pointwise_approach/","section":"publication","summary":"In a two-stage dose-response meta-analysis a common functional relationship is applied to each study and an overall curve is obtained by combining study-specific dose-response coefficients.

A pointwise approach for meta-analysis may overcome those limitations by combining predicted relative risks for a fine grid of exposure values based on potentially different dose-response models.We described how to flexibly model the dose-response association in a single study using fractional polynomials and spline, and how to present the combined results from study-specific analyses.The strategy is illustrated using aggregated data derived from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program, with results compared to the corresponding analysis based on individual data.Another example on milk consumption and all-cause mortality is used to show the advantages of the pointwise approach regarding flexibility in the dose-response analyses, limitations of extrapolations, and informativeness in presenting pooled results.Application of the proposed strategy may improve dose-response meta-analysis of observational studies in case of particularly heterogeneous exposure distributions.","tags":["Dose-response","Flexible model.","Meta-analysis","Pointwise average"],"title":"A Pointwise Approach to Dose-Response Meta-Analysis of Aggregated Data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alessio Crippa","Susanna C.

However, there are no studies that pool these data to show the shape of the relationship and quantify the mortality benefit from ideal CVH. METHODS AND RESULTS: We conducted a systematic internet literature search of multiple databases including MEDLINE, Web of Science, Embase, CINAHL, and Scopus for longitudinal studies assessing the relationship between ideal CVH and mortality in adults, published between January 1, 2010, and May 31, 2017. We included studies that assessed the relationship between ideal CVH and mortality in populations that were initially free of cardiovascular disease. We conducted a dose-response meta-analysis generating both study-specific and pooled trends from the correlated log hazard ratio estimates of mortality across categories of ideal CVH metrics. A total of 6 studies were included in the meta-analysis. All of the studies indicated a linear decrease in (cardiovascular disease and all-cause) mortality with increasing ideal CVH metrics. Overall, each unit increase in CVH metrics was associated with a pooled hazard ratio for cardiovascular disease mortality of 0.81 (95% confidence interval, 0.75-0.87), while each unit increase in ideal CVH metrics was associated with a pooled hazard ratio of 0.89 (95% confidence interval, 0.86-0.93) for all-cause mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Our meta-analysis showed a strong inverse linear dose-response relationship between ideal CVH metrics and both all-cause and cardiovascular disease-related mortality. This study suggests that even modest improvements in CVH is associated with substantial mortality benefit, thus providing a strong public health message advocating for even the smallest improvements in lifestyle.","tags":["cardiovascular disease prevention","cardiovascular disease risk factors","Cardiovascular Diseases","Global Health","Health Status","Humans","Life Style","mortality","Quality Indicators; Health Care","Risk Assessment","Risk Factors","Survival Rate"],"title":"Estimates of Mortality Benefit From Ideal Cardiovascular Health Metrics: A Dose Response Meta-Analysis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Andrea Discacciati","Alessio Crippa","Nicola Orsini"],"categories":null,"content":"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/jrsm.1194\n","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"18bd457fc812add675953b8a8f28c0c0","permalink":"https://6346b314635e8e77d95c6d10--luminous-stardust-9f8aab.netlify.app/publication/2017_goodness_of_fit_tool/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2017_goodness_of_fit_tool/","section":"publication","summary":"Goodness of fit evaluation should be a natural step in assessing and reporting dose–response meta-analyses from aggregated data of binary outcomes.

We performed a systematic review and meta‐analysis of existing studies and assessed the dose–response relation between potassium intake and stroke risk. Methods and Results We reviewed the observational cohort studies addressing the relation between potassium intake, and incidence or mortality of total stroke or stroke subtypes published through August 6, 2016. We carried out a meta‐analysis of 16 cohort studies based on the relative risk (RR) of stroke comparing the highest versus lowest intake categories. We also plotted a pooled dose–response curve of RR of stroke according to potassium intake. Analyses were performed with and without adjustment for blood pressure. Relative to the lowest category of potassium intake, the highest category of potassium intake was associated with a 13% reduced risk of stroke (RR=0.87, 95% CI 0.80–0.94) in the blood pressure–adjusted analysis. Summary RRs tended to decrease when original estimates were unadjusted for blood pressure. Analysis for stroke subtypes yielded comparable results. In the spline analysis, the pooled RR was lowest at 90~mmol of potassium daily intake (RRs=0.78, 95% CI 0.70–0.86) in blood pressure–adjusted analysis, and 0.67 (95% CI 0.57–0.78) in unadjusted analysis.

The most popular measure of heterogeneity, I2, was derived under an assumption of homogeneity of the within-study variances, which is almost never true, and the alternative estimator, , uses the harmonic mean to estimate the average of the within-study variances, which may also lead to bias. This paper thus presents a new measure for quantifying the extent to which the variance of the pooled random-effects estimator is due to between-studies variation, , that overcomes the limitations of the previous approach. We show that this measure estimates the expected value of the proportion of total variance due to between-studies variation and we present its point and interval estimators. The performance of all three heterogeneity measures is evaluated in an extensive simulation study. A negative bias for was observed when the number of studies was very small and became negligible as the number of studies increased, while and I2 showed a tendency to overestimate the impact of heterogeneity. The coverage of confidence intervals based upon was good across different simulation scenarios but was substantially lower for and I2, especially for high values of heterogeneity and when a large number of studies were included in the meta-analysis. The proposed measure is implemented in a user-friendly function available for routine use in r and sas. will be useful in quantifying the magnitude of heterogeneity in meta-analysis and should supplement the p-value for the test of heterogeneity obtained from the Q test.

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective studies assessing the association of non-fermented and fermented milk consumption with mortality from all causes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. PubMed was searched until August 2015. A two-stage, random-effects, dose-response meta-analysis was used to combine  study-specific results. Heterogeneity among studies was assessed with the I2 statistic. During follow-up periods ranging from 4.1 to 25 years, 70,743 deaths occurred among 367,505 participants. The range of non-fermented and fermented milk consumption and the shape of the associations between milk consumption and mortality differed considerably between studies. There was substantial heterogeneity among studies of non-fermented milk consumption in relation to mortality from all causes (12 studies; I2 = 94%), cardiovascular disease (five studies; I2 = 93%), and cancer (four studies; I2 = 75%) as well as among studies of fermented milk consumption and all-cause mortality (seven studies; I2 = 88%). Thus, estimating pooled hazard ratios was not appropriate. Heterogeneity among studies was observed in most subgroups defined by sex, country, and study quality. In conclusion, we observed no consistent association between milk consumption and all-cause or  cause-specific mortality.","tags":["cancer","cardiovascular disease","meta-analysis","milk","mortality"],"title":"Milk Consumption and Mortality from All Causes, Cardiovascular Disease, and Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alessio Crippa","Andrea Discacciati","Susanna C.

We conducted a dose-response meta-analysis of prospective studies to examine the dose-response associations between coffee consumption and mortality from all causes, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and all cancers. Pertinent studies, published between 1966 and 2013, were identified by searching PubMed and by reviewing the reference lists of the selected articles. Prospective studies in which investigators reported relative risks of mortality from all causes, CVD, and all cancers for 3 or more categories of coffee consumption were eligible. Results from individual studies were pooled using a random-effects model. Twenty-one prospective studies, with 121,915 deaths and 997,464 participants, met the inclusion criteria. There was strong evidence of nonlinear associations between coffee consumption and mortality for all causes and CVD (P for nonlinearity \u003c 0.001). The largest risk reductions were observed for 4 cups/day for all-cause mortality (16%, 95% confidence interval: 13, 18) and 3 cups/day for CVD mortality (21%, 95% confidence interval: 16, 26). Coffee consumption was not associated with cancer mortality. Findings from this meta-analysis indicate that coffee consumption is inversely associated with all-cause and CVD mortality.","tags":null,"title":"Coffee Consumption and Mortality From All Causes, Cardiovascular Disease, and Cancer: A Dose-Response Meta-Analysis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Daniela {Di Giuseppe}","Alessio Crippa","Nicola Orsini","Alicja Wolk"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1412035200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1412035200,"objectID":"41bb44226296d8e586ded2bbc6be622a","permalink":"https://6346b314635e8e77d95c6d10--luminous-stardust-9f8aab.netlify.app/publication/2014-09-30_fish_consumption_and/","publishdate":"2014-09-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2014-09-30_fish_consumption_and/","section":"publication","summary":"The association between fish consumption and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is unclear.
