abstract = "Inverse associations between physical activity (PA) and type 2 diabetes mellitus are well known. However, the shape of the dose–response relationship is still uncertain. This review synthesises results from longitudinal studies in general populations and uses non-linear models of the association between PA and incident type 2 diabetes."
