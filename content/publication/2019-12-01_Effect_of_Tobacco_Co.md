abstract = "Objectives To coherently examine the responsiveness of the Swedish National Tobacco Quitline (SNTQ) to different types of anti-smoking policies over an extended period of calendar time. Design Quasi-experimental design with an intervention time-series analysis based on 19 years series of data collected between January 1999 and August 2017 (224 months). Statistical inference on calling rates and rate ratios was obtained using intervention time-series models (Poisson regression and transfer functions). Participants A total of 179 851 phone calls to the SNTQ. Interventions Recent application of the 2014/40/ European Union (EU) Tobacco Products Directive in 2016. Historical interventions such as a campaign on passive smoking in January 2001; introduction of larger text warnings on cigarette packages since September 2002; banning smoking in restaurants since June 2005; and tobacco tax increase by 10% since January 2012. Outcome measure Calling rates to the SNTQ expressed per 100 000 smokers. Setting Sweden. Results The introduction of large pictorial warnings together with text warnings on cigarette packages (May 2016) was associated with a 35% increase in SNTQ calling rate (95% CI 1.16 to 1.57). The campaign on passive smoking (Jan 2001) was associated with a 61% higher calling rate (95% CI 1.06 to 2.45). Larger text warnings on cigarette packs (Sept 2002) conferred a 28% increment in the calling rate (95% CI 1.15 to 1.42); and prohibition to smoke in restaurants (Jun 2005) was associated with a 15% increase in the calling rate (95% CI 1.01 to 1.30). The 10% tobacco tax increase (Jan 2012) was associated with a 3% higher calling rate (95% CI 0.90 to 1.19). Conclusions Within an overall decreasing trend of daily smoking in Sweden, we found that the recent introduction of pictorial warnings together with text warnings and referral text had a discernible positive impact on the calling rates to the smoking quitline. We were also able to detect a likely impact of earlier nationwide interventions."
