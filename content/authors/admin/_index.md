I am a postdoctoral researcher in Epidemiology and Biostatistics at the Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics (MEB) at Karolinska Institutet (KI).
Since 2018, I work at MEB as postdoctoral researcher, where my research focuses on the design and analysis of modern trials to reduce the prostate cancer mortality by using genetics biomarkers to individualized treatment decision.
